// Replaces the old app's Service Worker at the old address (https://liorhen9.github.io/MathIt/).

// Phones that installed the app there keep running a Workbox Service Worker that serves the
// cached old app, even offline. Browsers check this file for updates when the app is opened, so
// this new version takes over: it deletes the old app's caches, removes itself, and reloads open
// windows – which then get the notice page (index.html) straight from the network.
// It never touches IndexedDB, so the family's data stays here until it is backed up.
